# data-science-study-notes
This is my first repository! So part of the point of this repository is for me to learn to use repositories, and Github in general. \(I still need to figure out what exactly is a "Git"!!\)  

I'm using this repo as a space to store my data science study notes, Python cheatsheets, resources to check out later, etc.  

## 0. **A little about me**
I'm trained in economics and international development, and I work in consulting. I started learning Python online because I wanted to work as a pre-doc RA for one of my professors during my master's degree, and being able to write code was one of the key requirements. I ended up not even getting an interview for the RA position, and started working for a small consulting firm instead in 2020, where the Python stuff turned out to be super useful, so I continued learning. 

## 1. Online learning

#### 1.1 Finished
- The [Python 3 Programming](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) **specialisation** offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera, which you can supposedly finish within a couple months instead of 24 - but hey I survived! And I kind of enjoyed it, too, which is why I've continued learning Python, a little bit of data science, and hopefully I'll go on to learn more about computer science in general.
- **Course 1** [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) in the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) specialisation. The course is beginner-friendly, the explanations are all very intuitive. The only bad thing about it is that a year from taking the course, I don't remember a thing from it.
- **Course 2** [Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)]() in the [Web Applications for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-applications) specialisation. 

#### 1.2 Now learning
- **Course 1** [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis?specialization=data-science-python) in the [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python). (20231109)

#### 1.3 Procrastinating
- The famous [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) offered by Harvard University on edX. I've been meaning to do this one for over a year now, and I've even paid for a certificate, but I keep getting stuck at the first lab (the Scratch one!!), because I'm simply not creative enough to come up with a game. Sad but true.

#### 1.4 Wish list
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), not that I *have* a CS education but still. [Chinese version](https://missing-semester-cn.github.io/) here.

## 2. Resources
#### 2.1 Computer science in general
- [CS自学指南](https://csdiy.wiki/), 听我说谢谢你！！
- 
#### 2.3 Data science in general
- [UMich Master in Applied Data Science (MADS) curriculum](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-applied-data-science/curriculum)
  
#### 2.2 Pandas
- [Pandas Idioms Cookbook](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/cookbook.html), can't believe I didn't know there were "idioms" - one of the moments when I realise there is a difference, after all, between having a proper CS education and not having one
